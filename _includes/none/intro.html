Very large numeric arrays (i.e. many gigabytes or even terabytes) can pose a significant computational challenge in imaging and many other areas of scientific data analysis. This is because analysts are frequently unfamiliar with the advanced memory management techniques required to work with such data using limited computational resources. zarr and dask are two Python libraries designed to facilitate analysis of very large arrays by 1) making efficient use of multiprocessor architecture and 2) "lazy loading" array data only when requested by a process. This workshop will provide an introduction to zarr and dask and walk through a few common use cases in image analysis.
